# EDGI Acronym Expander Chrome Extension

This tool attempts to expand acronyms commonly used in communications
among members of the Environmental Data & Governance Initiative (EDGI).

## Goal

To make it simpler for those participating in EDGI project conversations
to speak a common language with less jargon, with particular focus on
these groups:

  * **observers** who wish to better follow along,
  * **new contributors** who want to participate more freely, and
  * **existing contributors** visiting from other EDGI projects, for whom terms can seem foreign.

## Scope

This extension currently works on these websites:

  * archivers.slack.com
  * edgi.slack.com
